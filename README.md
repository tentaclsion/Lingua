Lingua is a live speech-to-text transcriber that automatically translates what a person is saying to another intended language and displays it as captions on the presenter's video feed. Works with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and anything that utilizes your camera feed as it creates a virtual camera stream with the captions burned onto it.

Lingua encompasses a broad spectrum of applications ranging from professional business settings to casual meetings with family and friends. As a result, it is intended for a wide variety of people, essentially, those who frequent online calls or presentations in all kinds of settings with a need to provide real-time translation. For example, this could be college professors broadcasting their lectures to the public, or even an international business meeting between two companies discussing acquisitions.
